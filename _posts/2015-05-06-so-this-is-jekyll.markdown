So this is Jekyll, it's pretty nice so far. If you've landed here then you've found the sucessor to my previous blog which was Wordpress based and as such a bit... Well
it was ok. I've decided to migrate to a static content platform rather than having to deal with all of that database driven CMS tedium. So far so good, going to try and 
write on this one a bit more as I can totally write this in SSH and make it look like I'm doing actual work at work and not just obviously writing on Wordpress.
